This is my personal Python repository. The purpose of this repository is to show my evolution with my main technology, Python. 
It is completely organized by folders for each month. The first file that was uploaded here was on 04/27/2025.
And I hope that by the day you are reading this Readme, this evolution of mine in programming will already be over, and that I am already working in the area. 

Feel free to take a look.
